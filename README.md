Homework for week 2, day 4/weekend 2

Explorer Mode
- don't consider Aces as possible 1's ... they are always 11s (this means you can bust on the deal)
- This is a 2 hand game (dealer and player)
- no splitting or funny business
- 1 deck in the game
- 52 card deck
- NO WILDS
- New deck every game
- deck must be shuffled every game
- no betting at all
- must have suits (ace of diamonds)
- Dealer hits if less than 16, otherwise dealer stays
- You enter what you play (hit or stay)
- No if you get 5 cards you win funnybusiness
- get as close to 21 without going over
- Must beat the dealer
- you can see 1 of dealers cards, while you are playing and both when your hand is over.
- If you get blackjack, you win automagically
- Ties go to the player

Adventure Mode
- You win if you have 6 cards and stay under 21
- Dealer wins if it draws blackjack before any player actions
- Ties go to the hand with the most cards, if still tied, it goes to the player

Epic Mode
- Add the idea of tracking your progress as you play over time.
- Let the player choose if an Ace is a 1 or an 11, or do it automatically.
- Add 7 decks to the game in a "Shoe", shuffle them all together, deal from the "Shoe"

Legendary Mode
- Tests for the game itself.
- Support for splitting.
- Have an advisor along the way that optionally gives a hint to the play on their best move.
